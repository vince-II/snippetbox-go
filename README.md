# Let's Go â€” Web Application in Go

This project is a hands-on implementation of the concepts from  
[_Let's Go: Build a Professional Web Application in Go_ by Alex Edwards](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/).

The goal is to learn how to design, build, and deploy a production-ready web application using Go.
